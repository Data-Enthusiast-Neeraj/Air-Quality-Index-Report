🌿## **Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard**



## **1. Project Title / Headline**
🌍 Breathing India: Interactive Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard
A clean, data-driven dashboard built using Power BI to visualize and analyze the air quality levels across Indian cities—highlighting pollution trends, critical pollutants, and AQI comparisons.



## **2. Short Description / Purpose**
This dashboard provides a comprehensive visual overview of air pollution metrics across various cities in India. It helps users track AQI levels, analyze pollutant concentration (PM2.5, CO, NO, SO₂), and monitor year-wise air quality trends. The tool is designed for policymakers, researchers, environmentalists, and the general public concerned with air pollution levels.



## **3. Tech Stack**
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary visualization platform for data storytelling.

📂 Power Query – Used for transforming, cleaning, and filtering city-wise AQI data.

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create average pollutant metrics and trend calculations.

📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established between city, pollutant types, and AQI trend data tables.

📁 File Format – .pbix for project development and .png for presentation.



## **4. Data Source**
Source: Open Government Pollution Dataset (e.g., CPCB or simulated dataset).

Dataset Includes:

City-wise AQI levels (2015–2020)

Concentration of key pollutants: PM2.5, CO, NO, and SO₂

Year-wise trends

City latitude & longitude data for mapping



## **5. Features / Highlights**
• Business Problem
Air pollution poses a major health risk in India, but accessing clear and comparative data across cities is challenging for decision-makers and the public.

• Goal of the Dashboard
To offer an easy-to-understand yet powerful analytical tool to:

Compare pollution levels across cities

Track which cities are improving or worsening

Highlight key pollutants contributing to air quality issues

Visualize pollution hotspots on the map

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals
KPI Indicators (Top Row):

🟣 Average PM2.5: 67.45

🔴 Average CO: 2.25

🟡 Average NO: 17.57

Top 10 Most Polluted Cities (Bar Chart):

Ahmedabad and Delhi top the list, exceeding AQI of 250.

Top 10 Least Polluted Cities (Bar Chart):

Aizawl, Shillong, and Coimbatore show the cleanest air among analyzed cities.

Geographical Map View (Bubble Map):

Interactive spatial overview of AQI across Indian cities with bubble size and color intensity indicating pollution levels.

AQI Trend Line (2015–2020):

Shows overall downward trend in AQI across years, indicating gradual improvement in air quality.



## **6. Business Impact & Insights**
Policy Support: Helps authorities identify the most affected cities for stricter environmental regulations.

Urban Planning: Supports city planners with long-term AQI trend data to design green initiatives.

Awareness Campaigns: Enables environmental organizations to build data-backed awareness in high-risk zones.

Research Utility: Valuable reference for air quality research across pollutants and timelines.
